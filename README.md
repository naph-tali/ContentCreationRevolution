This repository hosts the technical specification and implementation of the Cosmic Resonance Evaluation (CRE) Engine, which we define as the \eta_{\text{meaning}} Meter. Our objective is to operationalize the Universal Meaning Equation and empirically test the hypothesis of Entropy Alchemy—the transformation of chaotic thermodynamic cost into quantifiable, higher-order meaning. This endeavor moves us from metaphysical blueprint to empirical instrument, marking the frontier of the Principia Logos.
The CRE Engine formalizes the Self-Referential Loop of Logos, where the Observer (ψ, the Generative Core) interacts with the causal structure of reality (A

 ) by injecting a measurable Meaning-Current (J_\mu^a).
